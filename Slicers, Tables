Slicers

A slicer is a standalone chart that can be used to filter the other visuals on the page.

Slicers come in many different formats (category, range, date, etc.) and can be formatted to allow selection of only one, many, or all of the available values.

Slicers are a great choice to:

* Display commonly used or important filters on the report canvas for easier access.

* Make it easier to see the current filtered state without having to open a drop-down list.

* Filter by columns that are unneeded and hidden in the data tables.

* Create more focused reports by putting slicers next to important visuals.


Tables

A table is a grid that contains related data in a logical series of rows and columns. It may also contain headers and a row for totals.

Tables work well with quantitative comparisons where you are looking at many values for a single category. For example, this table displays five different measures for Category.

Tables are a great choice:

*To see and compare detailed data and exact values (instead of visual representations).

* To display data in a tabular format.
To display numerical data by categories.
