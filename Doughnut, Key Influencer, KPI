Visualization Types in Power BI



Dougnut Charts



Doughnut charts are similar to pie charts. They show the relationship of parts to a whole. 

The only difference is that the center is blank and allows space for a label or icon.



Key Influencer Chart



A key influencer chart displays the major contributors to a selected result or value.



Key influencers are a great choice to help you understand the factors that influence a key metric.





KPI



A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a visual cue that communicates the amount of progress made toward a measurable goal.



KPIs are a great choice:

To measure progress (what am I ahead or behind on?).

To measure distance to a metric (how far ahead or behind am I?).
