Visualization Types in Power BI



Matrix



The matrix visual is a type of table visual (see Tables in this article) that supports a stepped layout. A table supports two dimensions, but a matrix makes it easier to display data meaningfully across multiple dimensions. 



Often, report designers include matrixes in reports and dashboards to allow users to select one or more element (rows, columns, cells) in the matrix to cross-highlight other visuals on a report page.





Power App Visual



Report designers can create a Power App and embed it into a Power BI report as a visual. 



Consumers can interact with that visual within the Power BI report.



Q and A Visual



Similar to the Q&A experience on dashboards, the Q&A visual lets you ask questions about your data using natural language.
