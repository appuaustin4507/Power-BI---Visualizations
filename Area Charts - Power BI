Visualization Types in Power BI ..

1. Area Charts

In Power BI, The basic area Chart is based on the line charts with the area between axis and the line filled in.

Area Charts emphasize the magnitude of the change over time and can be used to draw attention to the overall total value across a trend line.

When do you use an Area chart?
=to see and compare the volume trend across a time series.

=for an individual series representing a physically countable set.





2.Funnel charts

Funnels help visualize a process that has stages, and items flow sequentially from one stage to the next. One example is a sales process that starts with leads and ends with purchase fulfillment.

For example, a sales funnel that tracks customers through stages: Lead > Qualified Lead > Prospect > Contract > Close. At a glance, the shape of the funnel conveys the health of the process you're tracking. Each funnel stage represents a percentage of the total. So, in most cases, a funnel chart is shaped like a funnel -- with the first stage being the largest, and each subsequent stage smaller than its predecessor. A pear-shaped funnel is also useful -- it can identify a problem in the process. But typically, the first stage, the "intake" stage, is the largest.
