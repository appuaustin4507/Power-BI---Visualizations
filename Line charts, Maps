Visualization Types in Power BI



Line Charts



Line charts emphasize the overall shape of an entire series of values, usually over time.



Basic Map



Use a basic map to associate both categorical and quantitative information with spatial locations.



Filled Map



A filled map uses shading or tinting or patterns to display how a value differs in proportion across a geography or region. 



Quickly display these relative differences with shading that ranges from light (less-frequent/lower) to dark (more-frequent/more).



Shape Map



Shape maps compare regions on a map using color. A shape map can't show precise geographical locations of data points on a map. 



Instead, its main purpose is to show relative comparisons of regions on a map by coloring them differently.
