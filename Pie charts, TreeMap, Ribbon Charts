Visualization types in Power BI



Pie Charts



Pie charts show the relationship of parts to a whole.





Ribbon Charts



Ribbon charts show which data category has the highest rank (largest value). 



Ribbon charts are effective at showing rank change, with the highest range (value) always displayed on top for each time period.





TreeMaps



Treemaps are charts of colored rectangles, with size representing value. They can be hierarchical, with rectangles nested within the main rectangles. 



The space inside each rectangle is allocated based on the value being measured. And the rectangles are arranged in size from top left (largest) to bottom right (smallest).



Treemaps are a great choice:



*To display large amounts of hierarchical data.



*When a bar chart can't effectively handle the large number of values.



*To show the proportions between each part and the whole.



*To show the pattern of the distribution of the measure across each level of categories in the hierarchy.



*To show attributes using size and color coding.



*To spot patterns, outliers, most-important contributors, and exceptions.
